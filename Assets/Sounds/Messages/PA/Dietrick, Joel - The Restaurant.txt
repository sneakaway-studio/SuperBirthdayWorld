In the fall of 1996, Joelle was working at Carnegie Mellon Univ and I had a trip to Pittsburgh. A friend of mine made reservations for us at the Le Mont Restaurant, Pittsburghâ€™s only Five-Star Diamond Award Winning Restaurant, at the top of Mt Washington overlooking the city. We were seated way back from the windows overlooking Pittsburgh, but what was interesting was the meal. We got our drinks and appetizer, and when we were through with the appetizer, they served a small dish of sorbet. After the salad, another small dish of sorbet was served. Then after our entree, we got another small dish of sorbet, then had dessert, paid our bill and left. It was the first time we experienced cleansing our palates between each course with sorbet. It was a wonderful evening! When Jan got the credit card statement, she could not believe that the cost was $125 (1996).
