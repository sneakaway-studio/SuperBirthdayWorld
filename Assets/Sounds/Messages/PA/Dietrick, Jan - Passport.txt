Joelle has traveled more outside of the USA than any of the family. However, she has “forgotten” an essential part of that travel a couple of times–the passport. When she was in graduate school at UCSD, we agreed on a week at Cancun, Mexico, to celebrate her 35th birthday. I paid for an all-inclusive stay at RUI Caribe in Cancun. A few days before our departure date, Joelle called to say she could not go because her passport had expired. She knew that I was UNHAPPY so she traveled from San Diego to Los Angeles where she was able to get the passport renewed and then met me in Cancun. Then she was traveling to Germany with Owen when she was pregnant with Sophia. They spent time with us before we took them to JFK for their overseas flight. While at breakfast a few days before their departure, I jokingly said “I hope your passport is current.” A funny look passed over Joelle’s face and shortly thereafter she left the table. She returned to say “I don’t have my passport.” Joel drove her to Philadelphia where she was able to get a new passport to replace the “lost” passport.
