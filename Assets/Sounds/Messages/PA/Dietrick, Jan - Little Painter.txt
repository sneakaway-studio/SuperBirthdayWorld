I have a first birthday story about Joelle. She was in the living room playing with her toys–I specifically remember the noise the toy telephone made and she was being so good. I was in the kitchen making her birthday cake.  When I went around the corner to talk with her I was greeted with a ‘horror” scene. She had pooped and her diaper tab broke dropping it all for her enjoyment.  Always the artist, she was painting the loveseat upholstery with the “fun finger” paints. I picked her up and took her directly to the bathtub where I cleaned that lovely child of her paints.
