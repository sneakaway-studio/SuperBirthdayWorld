I recently found a picture of Joelle and I playing pool in San Diego, we were so young and jovial! You are the only person that I maintain contact with, though sporadically from CMU. I'm so glad we overlapped in PGH and have remained in touch. Please don't forget to reach out whenever you are visiting NYC! Many hugs to you and the family. Congrats on making it to 50 years young!!!
