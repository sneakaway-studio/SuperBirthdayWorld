I'm sure most people have funny stories like me thinking you were a princess when I learned you were homecoming(?) queen, but I'm going to make mine sappy because I don't think I ever properly thanked you, though I've intended to many many times. I was a freshman in college and my dad was getting sick and getting sicker. You mailed me a shirt, but that was nothing compared to the thoughtful card you sent along with it. You may not even remember writing it, but that card has gotten me though a lot and I still look back on it when when feeling blue. Thank you for always being an amazing and thoughtful older cousin, happy happy birthday! â€“ Kris
