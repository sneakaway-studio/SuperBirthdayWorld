Happy, happy 50th Birthday Joelle!  Wow, time flies!  We met in 1991 in Simmons Hall at Penn State.  We became fast friends and were roommates through much of our time in Happy Valley!  It has been amazing to watch your travels since college and how you have stayed true to your dreams.  I wish you an amazing birthday filled with happiness and love!  If you ever find yourself in Pennsylvania, both of my boys now attend Penn State (crazy!) and I would love to reconnect with you, Owen and Sophia!  Happy Birthday!
